#FeedMe
##Built at PennApps XII

FeedMe takes all the hassle out of deciding what to eat. Simply take a picture of your groceries, and FeedMe will automatically identify each ingredient using machine learning techniques. From there, FeedMe will recommend recipes based on the ingredients that users have available. If you're missing an ingredient or two, your FaceBook friends have you covered. FeedMe connects users to their FaceBook friends, and lets you know when a friend has an ingredient you need to make your tasty dinner.
